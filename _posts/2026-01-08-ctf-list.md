### Free Cybersecurity & CTF Learning Resources (Links Shared Separately)

I shared a PDF that curates high-quality cybersecurity, CTF, and hands-on learning platforms.  
Since PDFs don’t always allow clickable links, I’m sharing the direct access links here for easy use.

🔐 Hands-On Cybersecurity & CTF Platforms (FREE):
- [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) – Unlimited free binary exploitation & systems security
- [OverTheWire](https://lnkd.in/e2zxEkAh) – Classic Linux & security wargame
- [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://lnkd.in/eyMR79Cm) – 300+ free real-world web labs
- [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com) – 500+ free vulnerable machines
- [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org) – Blue Team & SOC challenges
- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org) – Beginner-friendly CTFs by Carnegie Mellon University
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) – Guided learning paths

💡 Pro Tip:  
Start with free rooms (complete all free) → take ONE month of premium → complete all paid modules intensively → earn certificates → cancel. Maximum ROI.

⚠️ First-timer note:  
If TryHackMe feels slow or won’t connect, search YouTube for “OpenVPN TryHackMe setup” — this resolves most issues.
